# Teach It Forward - The Campaign for Williams
In October 2015, Williams launched the public phase of the most ambitious comprehensive

The Teach It Forward campaign sought to unite the Williams community around a shared vision for the college’s future, building support for its enduring liberal arts values and evolving student and faculty populations as, together, we answer the fundamental questions, “Who will we be?” “How will we teach and learn?” and “What difference will we make?”
